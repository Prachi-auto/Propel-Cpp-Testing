# Propel-Cpp-Testing

Aspects to test:

- Coding guidelines
- C++ Best practices - https://github.com/cpp-best-practices/cppbestpractices
- Runtime optimizations suggestions:
   - Suggest the algorithm which consumes less runtime
   - avoid creation of unnecessary (or extra types) for non-trivial data types.
- Design suggestions (trying to follow SOLID principles, design patterns) Open: will this work for incremental changes?
- MISRA Warnings
- Coverity warnings
- Test duplications on GTest files (on incremental testing)
- Avoid usage of heap memory allocation using Custom allocators.
- Clean code guidelines - https://github.com/martinmurciego/good-books/blob/master/Clean%20Code_%20A%20Handbook%20of%20Agile%20Software%20Craftsmanship%20-%20Robert%20C.%20Martin.pdf
